# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Embedded JSON Schema files now match `display-protocol/dp1-go` (`internal/schema/`). Validation is stricter and aligned with the Go reference SDK.
- `DisplayForItem` merge uses field-level overlay semantics from `dp1-go/merge` instead of shallow object assignment.

### Validation (breaking for previously loose payloads)

- `license` must be one of `open`, `token`, or `subscription` when present on playlist items or defaults.
- `provenance.type` is required; `onChain` and `seriesRegistry` require a `contract` object.
- `repro` fields use pattern constraints (for example `seed`, `assetsSHA256`, `frameHash`).
- Ref manifest schema validates structured `metadata`, `controls`, and thumbnail dimensions.
- Channel schema `$id` is `extensions/channels/v1.0.0`; signature role `publisher` is accepted.

### Added

- Regression tests for stricter validation and merge parity edge cases.
